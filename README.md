# the-stick-of-centrism
this game allegorically visualises miserable lives of centrists who just move around leftists, rightists, conservatives, liberals, communists, more radical groups etc. everyday, avoid any conflict and stoutly keep moving upwards. the goal is to maintain the balance no matter what happens around you and who is actually right.
