# the-stick-of-centrism
this game allegorically visualises miserable lives of centrists who just moves around leftists, rightists, conservatives, liberals, communists, more radical groups etc. everyday, avoids any conflict and stoutly keeps moving upwards. the goal is to maintain the balance no matter what happens around you and who is actually right.
